# Visualization-of-2D-FFT-in-RGB
This is for a science project I did that used the 2D FFT to manipulate images. This code is only an extensino of code created by Stephen Gruppetta and can be found at https://thepythoncodingbook.com/2021/08/30/2d-fourier-transform-in-python-and-fourier-synthesis-of-images/
