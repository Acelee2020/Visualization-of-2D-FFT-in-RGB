# Visualization-of-2D-FFT-in-RGB
This is for a science project I did that used the 2D FFT to manipulate images. This code is only an extensino of code created by Stephen Gruppetta and can be found at https://thepythoncodingbook.com/2021/08/30/2d-fourier-transform-in-python-and-fourier-synthesis-of-images/

What this code does is it takes an RGB image and splits it into its three color channels. The 2D FFT is performed on these channels the sine waves of the image are slowy added together to get the originial image back

To understand this better I HIGHLY recommend reading the article that is linked above

Yes this is inefficient, yes it is slow, yes there are probably better ways to do this. For my purposes, I only needed it to give me some images and that's what it did.

There is an extra popup when running this program while the sine waves are being added, I do not know how to get rid of it.

Also up until almost all the sine waves are added, there are color splotches in the image which is something that I am still trying to figure out. They do go away in the end

I hope this code is usefull to someone and I hope they don't mind the utter nonsense I have written and all the grammatical errors and ineffeciences that come with it.
